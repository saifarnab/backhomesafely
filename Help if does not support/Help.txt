Use System32 - Shortcut and paste msvcr120d.dll file(from any of folder 1 or 2) there.



If that doesn't work, you will have to extract the file to your system directory.

By default, this is C:\Windows\System (Windows 95/98/Me), C:\WINNT\System32 (Windows NT/2000),
or C:\Windows\System32 (Windows XP, Vista, 7).

Make sure overwrite any existing files (but make a backup copy of the original file).


Reboot your computer. 
If the problem still occurs, try the following:


1. Press Start and select Run.
2. Type CMD and press Enter (or if you use Windows ME, type COMMAND).

3. Type regsvr32 "filename".dll and press Enter.
